React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

>>>
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!


>>>
React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called createRoot() and its method render().

The createRoot() function takes one argument, an HTML element.

The purpose of the function is to define the HTML element where a React component should be displayed.
The render() method is then called to define the React component that should be rendered.

What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.

JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.

With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>;

JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not correct, or if the HTML misses a parent element.

Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

Class Component
A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

Function Component
Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

Note that the Components filename must start with an uppercase character.

React Props
React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:
